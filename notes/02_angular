- Starting a New Project

    # Start new project with default options
    $ ng new stock-market



- Understanding the Angular CLI

    - Running the Application

        # Run the server in development mode on port 4200
        $ ng serve

        ** NG Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200,
           open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ **

        webpack: Compiled successfully.



    - We can see that the files needed to serve the application were created:

        inline.bundle.js
          Tiny file with webpack utilities and loaders that is needed for 
            bootstrapping the application.

        main.bundle.js
          The transpiled code that is specific to your application.

        polyfills.bundle.js
          Includes all the polyfills needed for supporting some capabilities in 
            older browsers (like advanced ECMAScript features not yet available 
            in all browsers).

        styles.bundle.js
          Compilation of all the CSS styles that are needed for your application.

        vendor.bundle.js
          Includes all the third-party libraries and frameworks you depend on 
            (including Angular).
